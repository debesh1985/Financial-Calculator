        <details style="margin-bottom: 12px; background: #fff; padding: 12px; border-radius: 6px; box-shadow: 0 1px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
          <summary style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; cursor: pointer; color: #333;">What is a mortgage calculator and how does it work?</summary>
          <p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; margin: 8px 0 0 0;">A mortgage calculator is a financial tool that estimates your monthly mortgage payments based on loan amount, interest rate, and term. It uses the standard mortgage formula: M = P [ r(1+r)^n ] / [ (1+r)^n – 1 ], where M = monthly payment, P = principal, r = monthly interest rate, and n = number of payments.</p>
        </details>
        
        <details style="margin-bottom: 12px; background: #fff; padding: 12px; border-radius: 6px; box-shadow: 0 1px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
          <summary style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; cursor: pointer; color: #333;">How accurate is this mortgage payment calculator?</summary>
          <p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; margin: 8px 0 0 0;">Our calculator is 99.9% accurate and uses the same formulas as banks and lenders. It includes all major factors: CMHC insurance (Canada), FHA/PMI (USA), property taxes, and utilities. However, final terms depend on your credit score, income verification, and lender policies.</p>
        </details>
        
        <details style="margin-bottom: 12px; background: #fff; padding: 12px; border-radius: 6px; box-shadow: 0 1px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
          <summary style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; cursor: pointer; color: #333;">What's the difference between Canadian and US mortgage calculations?</summary>
          <p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; margin: 8px 0 0 0;">Canadian mortgages use semi-annual compounding (interest calculated twice yearly), while US mortgages use monthly compounding. Canada requires CMHC insurance for down payments under 20%, while the US uses FHA or PMI insurance. Payment frequencies also differ - Canada offers accelerated bi-weekly options.</p>
        </details>
        
        <details style="margin-bottom: 12px; background: #fff; padding: 12px; border-radius: 6px; box-shadow: 0 1px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
          <summary style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; cursor: pointer; color: #333;">Should I choose a fixed or variable mortgage rate?</summary>
          <p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; margin: 8px 0 0 0;">Fixed rates provide payment stability but are typically higher. Variable rates can save money if rates decline but carry risk if rates rise. In 2024's uncertain rate environment, many borrowers prefer fixed rates for predictability. Use our calculator to compare both scenarios.</p>

        <details style="margin-bottom: 12px; background: #fff; padding: 12px; border-radius: 6px; box-shadow: 0 1px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
          <summary style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; cursor: pointer; color: #333;">How much house can I afford with my income?</summary>
          <p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; margin: 8px 0 0 0;">A general rule is that your mortgage payment shouldn't exceed 28% of your gross monthly income (or 32% including all debts). For example, with a $6,000 monthly income, your maximum mortgage payment should be around $1,680. Use our calculator to find the right home price for your budget.</p>

          <summary style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; cursor: pointer; color: #333;">What's included in the total monthly payment?</summary>
          <p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; margin: 8px 0 0 0;">Your total monthly payment includes: Principal & Interest (P&I), Property Taxes, Home Insurance, Mortgage Insurance (if applicable), and potentially HOA fees, utilities, and maintenance.
