      <div style="background: #fff; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 24px; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
        <p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 16px;">Term life insurance premiums are calculated based on several key factors that insurance companies use to assess risk:</p>
        <ul style="padding-left: 20px; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 14px;">
          <li><strong>Age:</strong> The primary factor - premiums increase with age due to higher mortality risk</li>
          <li><strong>Health Status:</strong> Medical exams and health questionnaires determine your risk class</li>
          <li><strong>Coverage Amount:</strong> Higher death benefits require higher premiums</li>
          <li><strong>Policy Term:</strong> Longer terms typically have higher initial premiums but lock in rates</li>
          <li><strong>Lifestyle Factors:</strong> Smoking, occupation, and hobbies affect your risk profile</li>
          <li><strong>Gender:</strong> Women typically pay slightly less due to longer life expectancy</li>
        </ul>

          <summary style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; cursor: pointer; color: #333;">What is term life insurance?</summary>
          <p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; margin: 8px 0 0 0;">Term life insurance provides coverage for a specific period (10, 20, or 30 years). If you die during the term, your beneficiaries receive the death benefit. It's the most affordable type of life insurance and ideal for temporary needs like mortgage protection or income replacement.</p>

          <p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; margin: 8px 0 0 0;">Age and health are the biggest factors. Smoking can double or triple your premiums. High-risk occupations and hobbies can add 25-100% to your base rate. Gender has a smaller impact (5-15% difference). The coverage amount directly affects the premium dollar amount.</p>

          <summary style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; cursor: pointer; color: #333;">Should I choose 10, 20, or 30-year term?</summary>
          <p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; margin: 8px 0 0 0;">Choose based on your needs duration: 10-year for short-term debt, 20-year for child-rearing years, 30-year for mortgage protection. Longer terms cost more initially but lock in rates. Consider your age - if you're young, 30-year terms offer great long-term value.</p>
