1) URLs & hreflang
Create two crawlable routes that render server-independent (static):

/us/term-life-insurance-premium-calculator/ (default currency USD, US copy)

/ca/term-life-insurance-premium-calculator/ (default currency CAD, CA copy)

Add hreflang tags in both pages:

en-US ↔ https://<domain>/us/term-life-insurance-premium-calculator/

en-CA ↔ https://<domain>/ca/term-life-insurance-premium-calculator/

Add rel=canonical to each page pointing to itself.

The existing country toggle should navigate between these two URLs (not just switch text).

2) Head tags (both pages)
Title (≤60 chars):

US: Term Life Insurance Premium Calculator (USA) – Estimate Monthly Cost

CA: Term Life Insurance Premium Calculator (Canada) – Estimate Monthly Cost

Meta description (140–160 chars): concise, includes target keywords and benefits.

Open Graph & Twitter Cards: og:title, og:description, og:url, og:image (use provided og-image.png), twitter:card=summary_large_image.

Preload/Preconnect: none to external fonts; use system font stack for best CWV.

Favicon and app icons.

3) Content & on-page SEO
H1: “Term Life Insurance Premium Calculator (USA/Canada)”

Intro (150–220 words) explaining what term life is, how coverage is estimated (income replacement + liabilities), and how age, job risk, health, smoking/alcohol, and term length influence price. Use natural language and keywords:

“Life Insurance 101”

“How much coverage do I need?”

Last updated date near the calculator (auto-filled current date).

4) FAQ section (expanders + schema)
Add a visible FAQ below results and include FAQPage JSON-LD with the same Q&As.

FAQ items (use concise, plain language answers 2–5 sentences each):

What is term life insurance and how does it work?

How do you calculate the recommended coverage amount?

What affects term life premiums the most (age, health, smoking, job, term length)?

Which term length (10/20/30 years) should I choose?

Do I need a medical exam?

Are premiums tax-deductible? (note personal policies generally aren’t; advise users to consult a tax professional)

Can I change or convert my term policy later?

How accurate is this calculator vs a quote?

5) Structured data (JSON-LD)
Embed all JSON-LD in <script type="application/ld+json">:

WebSite with potentialAction = SearchAction (site search optional).

WebPage (name, description, inLanguage).

BreadcrumbList: Home → Calculators → Term Life Insurance Premium Calculator.

SoftwareApplication (or WebApplication) describing the calculator:
applicationCategory: "FinanceApplication", operatingSystem: "Web", offers with "price": "0", "priceCurrency": "USD" or "CAD".

FAQPage containing the 10 Q&As above.

6) Performance & CWV targets
LCP ≤ 2.0s, CLS ≤ 0.05, INP ≤ 200ms on mid-range mobile.

No external fonts or blocking CSS/JS. Inline critical CSS (<10kb) or load styles.css with media="print" + onload pattern (optional). Defer script.js.

Compress og-image.png (~1200×630) and any icons.

Use loading="lazy" for non-critical images and fetchpriority="high" for LCP image if any.

7) Technical SEO
Generate sitemap.xml listing both routes and the homepage.

Provide robots.txt allowing crawl of both routes.

Add canonical URLs as noted above.

Add meta name="robots" content="index,follow" only on production.

Add schema Organization in the homepage (if available) and link via sameAs to social profiles (placeholders).

Use descriptive alt text on all images.

Add event tracking hooks (data- attributes) to measure interactions (optional).

8) UI polish (mobile-first)
Maintain the existing calculator UI and results.

Add an SEO text block (US and CA variants) under the calculator (~300–500 words each) using natural phrasing and the target keywords (no stuffing).

Keep the disclaimer near results and in the footer:

“This is an approximate estimate. Actual premiums depend on insurer underwriting, health disclosures, and regulations. This tool is not financial, legal, or medical advice.”

9) Accessibility
Logical heading order.

Labels associated with inputs; visible focus states.

Results area has aria-live="polite".

10) Delivery
Update index.html, styles.css, script.js to include all above.

Create /us/ and /ca/ static copies with correct hreflang/canonical, currency defaults, and localized copy.

Include sitemap.xml, robots.txt, og-image.png.

Write a short README summarizing SEO decisions and how to edit FAQ/JSON-LD.

If helpful, also attach a short keyword map (primary/secondary/LSI for US & CA) inside the README and note where each appears (Title, H1, meta description, H2s, intro, FAQ).
