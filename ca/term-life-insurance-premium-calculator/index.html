      <h2>How We Calculate Coverage</h2>
      <p>Our <strong>Canadian term life insurance calculator</strong> uses industry-standard actuarial tables to estimate premiums for the Canadian market. We calculate your recommended coverage based on income replacement needs plus outstanding liabilities like mortgages, loans, and future expenses such as children's education costs.</p>

      <h3>How Premiums Are Estimated</h3>
      <p>Term life insurance premiums in Canada are primarily determined by your mortality risk. Age is the biggest factor, with rates typically doubling every 10-15 years. Health status, determined through medical exams and health questionnaires, can significantly impact your rate class and final premium.</p>

      <h3>Risk Multipliers (Age, Health, Habits, Job)</h3>
      <p>Several factors influence your <strong>Canadian term insurance premium calculator</strong> results:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Age:</strong> The primary risk factor - premiums increase exponentially with age</li>
        <li><strong>Health:</strong> Medical conditions can increase premiums by 25-150% or more</li>
        <li><strong>Smoking:</strong> Tobacco use typically doubles or triples premium costs</li>
        <li><strong>Occupation:</strong> High-risk jobs add 15-80% to base premiums</li>
        <li><strong>Term Length:</strong> Longer terms cost more initially but lock in rates</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Canada vs US Differences</h3>
      <p>Canadian <strong>life insurance estimates</strong> are typically 10-20% lower than US rates due to different mortality tables, universal healthcare system, and regulatory environment. The Canadian market has fewer but well-established insurers with consistent underwriting standards.</p>

      <h3 id="coverage-guide">How Much Life Insurance Coverage Do I Need?</h3>
      <p>A common rule for <strong>Canadian life insurance estimate</strong> calculations is 10-12 times your annual income. However, consider your specific situation: outstanding debts, future financial obligations, your family's lifestyle needs, and existing savings or insurance coverage. Our calculator helps you see costs for different coverage amounts to find the right balance.</p>

    <!-- FAQ Section -->
    <section class="faq-section">
      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What is term life insurance and how does it work?</summary>
        <p>Term life insurance provides coverage for a specific period (usually 10, 20, or 30 years) at a fixed premium rate. If you die during the term, your beneficiaries receive the full death benefit tax-free. It's the most affordable type of life insurance, ideal for temporary needs like mortgage protection or income replacement during child-rearing years.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How do you calculate the recommended coverage amount?</summary>
        <p>We use the income replacement method: multiply your annual income by 10-12, then add outstanding debts and future expenses like children's education. Subtract existing life insurance and savings. This ensures your family can maintain their lifestyle and meet financial obligations without your income.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What affects term life premiums the most (age, health, smoking, job, term length)?</summary>
        <p>Age has the biggest impact, with premiums roughly doubling every 10-15 years. Health status is second most important - chronic conditions can increase rates by 50-200%. Smoking typically doubles or triples premiums. High-risk occupations add 15-80%, while term length affects the level premium structure.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Do pre-existing conditions always raise premiums?</summary>
        <p>Not always. Minor conditions like controlled high blood pressure or diabetes may result in standard or slightly higher rates. Well-managed conditions with good medical records often qualify for preferred rates. Serious conditions like cancer or heart disease typically result in higher premiums or coverage limitations.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How are US and Canada premiums different?</summary>
        <p>Canadian premiums are generally 10-20% lower than US rates due to different mortality tables, universal healthcare system, and regulatory environment.

        <summary>Which term length (10/20/30 years) should I choose?</summary>
        <p>Choose based on your needs duration: 10-year for short-term debt coverage, 20-year for child-rearing period, 30-year for mortgage protection or longer-term needs.

If you die during the term, your beneficiaries receive the full death benefit tax-free. It's the most affordable type of life insurance, ideal for temporary needs like mortgage protection or income replacement during child-rearing years."

Smoking typically doubles or triples premiums. High-risk occupations add 15-80%, while term length affects the level premium structure."
